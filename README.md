# shop-api :shopping:
The REST API is implemented as JSON over HTTP using all four verbs (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE). Each resource, like Order, Product, or Collection, has a distinct URL and is manipulated in isolation. In other words, weâ€™ve tried to make the API follow the REST principles as much as possible.

## API Routes
- dev-s01edge.kihoon.lab.com/products [GET, POST]
- dev-s01edge.kihoon.lab.com/products/{:id} [GET, PATCH, DELETE]
- dev-s01edge.kihoon.lab.com/orders [GET, POST]
- dev-s01edge.kihoon.lab.com/orders{:id} [GET, DELETE]

## Server Logging 
- **morgan** (https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan)
- **dotenv** (https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

## Handling CORS
```javascript
/*  CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
    Client = localhost:4000
    Server = localhost:3000
    -sending *headers* from the server to the client (to give access)
*/

// Before any Routes, we send headers
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization')
    if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
        res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE, GET');
        return res.status(200).json({});
    }
    next();
});
```

## Product Schema
```javascript
const productSchema = mongoose.Schema({
    _id: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    name: String,
    price: Number
});
```
